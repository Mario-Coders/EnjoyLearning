## Learning Deep Structured Semantic Models for Web Search using Clickthrough Data

### Abstract

- develop a series of new latent semantic models with a deep structure 
    - that project queries and documents into a common low-dimensional space
    - where the relevance of a document given a query is readily computed as the distance between them.
- use a technique called word hashing
    - which is shown to effectively scale up our semantic models to handle large vocabularies which are common in such tasks.
